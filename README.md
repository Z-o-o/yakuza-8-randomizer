# Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth Randomizer
A modification for Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth (A.K.A Yakuza 8) that randomizes enemies and skills through the game.

# A Warning on Stability/Balancing:
This version (1.0) is mostly stable, the main story is completable, substories have not been tested.

Due to the unpredictable nature of randomizers, there can't be a guarentee on balancing. Enemies are balanced to what level they appear at, however summons can be unpredictable and of course skills that are randomized can also be too strong/too weak as well. You've been warned!!!

**AVOID** Interacting with sujimon, they have been lightly tested and they are very unstable. If you see the oppurtunity to catch a sujimon I would recommend avoiding at all costs *UNLESS* you are Ichiban and are walking through Hawaii.

Enemy QTEs are also a bit unstable, and softlocking has a small chance of happening, but this should hopefully be completely avoidable except for a small amount of levels/maps. 

# How to use (Please use Shin Ryu Mod Manager (SRMM)):
 ## Step 1:
  
  Download the Y8 Infinite Wealth Randomizer.exe file. This will generate SRMM compatible mod folders with the randomized files.
  
 ## Step 2:
  
  Simply run Randomizer.exe, and once it is completed drag the generated "[Enemy/Skill] Randomizer Seed - [Numbers]" folder into your SRMM mods folder (located in your game files)

 ## Step 3:

  Run SRMM (whether through the exe or the GUI) and apply the mods, this way the randomizer mod is successfully applied to your game.
 
 ## Step 4:
  You have now successfully randomized your enemies/skills in Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth. Nothing else is required and enjoy! If you'd like to randomize your
  enemies/skills again its just as simple as rerunning Y8 Infinite Wealth Randomizer.exe file and replacing the one in your mods folder with the new one.
